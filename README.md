## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with challenge 4 because I forgot I add to create an element using `document.createElement()` and not just `createElement()`. I also didn't realize that a for each loop in JS used `of` instead of `in`. My game cards were displaying as undefined because of this mix up, but thankfully the TFM Adriana Morales was able to help me and find the solution.

I also have a bug with my laptop that uses the cache from a previous lab assignment, so in order to refresh my page locally, I have to manually delete the cache every time (I don't know how to solve this I already tried deleting the old files. If anyone knows what's going on, help would be appreciated).
