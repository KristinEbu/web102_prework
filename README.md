## Notes

I had a lot of trouble with challenge 4 because I forgot I add to create an element using `document.createElement()` and not just `createElement()`

I also have a bug with my laptop that uses the cache from a previous lab assignment, so in order to refresh my page locally, I have to manually delete the cache every time (I don't know how to solve this I already tried deleting the old files. If anyone knows what's going on, help would be appreciated).

The information of the games also don't display correctly locally so that is why I uploaded the page on Github Pages and filmed by gif using that.
